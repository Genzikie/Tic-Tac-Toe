Overview
  
		Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple two-player game that can be played with a pen and a piece of paper. It's also one of the simplest Python games to create. You can do it on a console, but we'll use Tkinter to create a graphical user interface.

Mechanics of Tic-Tac-Toe
		In Tic Tac Toe, the goal is to get three in a row. You play on a three-by-three gaming board. The first player is known as X, and the second as O. Players take turns alternating between placing Xs and Os on the playing area till one of them has three in a row or all nine tiles are filled. When no one has three in a row, the stalemate is referred to as a cat game.

Features

The program displays a simple menu with the title, the ERovoutika logo, and the play button.









Figure 1. Main menu.

	When you press the play button, a tic-tac-toe game board appears in place of the menu window. The game board is made up of 3x3 buttons that, when clicked, reveal a symbol. The X player is represented by X-shaped tools, while the O player is represented by a gear. The X player will make the first move in the game.

Figure 3. X and O symbols.

	The program's goal is to get three consecutive Xs or Os. If there are three Xs in a row, a message box with the words "X Wins!" will appear. The message box will say "O Wins!" if there are three Os. If the board is full and there are no threes in a row from either symbol, the message box will display "Cat game!" “It's a tie!” When the match is concluded, the game board will be restored to its original condition.
